The goal is to build a classification model that predicts from which subject area a certain abstract originates. The plan would be that next week we will discuss your learnings from the theory part, that means you are relatively free to fill your Learning Portfolio on this new topic and in two weeks we will discuss your solutions of the Classification Model.\n",
