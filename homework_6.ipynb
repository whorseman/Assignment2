The target column has only the property Q or F, which is to be modeled. As always, please create a train and a test data set, e.g. 80:20 or 90:10. Your goal is to create a neural network that best predicts the target column. Use probabilities with the sigmoid function as discussed in the theory. When designing your neural network, play with a few different numbers and sizes of layers and different activation functions.\n",
